# Accounting Ledger Capstone

My name is **Shewit Hailu**, and I am a student in the **Year Up** program ‚Äî a national workforce development initiative that helps young adults gain professional and technical skills.

This project is my Application Development Capstone for the Year Up program. I am **Shewit Hailu**, a **Year Up student** currently developing my skills in software engineering and application development.

## üìù Notes

**File Handling:** Managing reading and writing transactions to a file required careful exception handling and data validation.

**Formatting Reports:** Ensuring transactions displayed in a clear, readable table format was a challenge that required string formatting and consistent spacing.

**Code Structure:** Applying object-oriented principles (classes for Transaction, Ledger, and Main) improved modularity and maintainability.

## Interesting Piece of Code
1. The customSearch() method is among my project's most intriguing features. With this tool, users can go through the accounting ledger's transactions using a variety of available filters, including date range, vendor, amount, and description.
2. This code demonstrates flexible and user-friendly filtering logic. Each search parameter is optional ‚Äî users can press ‚ÄúS‚Äù to skip any filter.
